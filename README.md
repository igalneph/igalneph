<h1 align="left">Hi, I'm Yigal! 👋</h1>
<h3 align="left">CS Graduate | Software Developer</h3>

<p align="left">
I began my journey by building applications for iOS and later expanded my skills while studying Computer Science with a minor in Neuroscience at university. During my studies, I developed expertise in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Operating Systems, and Object-Oriented Programming. Now, I’m eager to apply this knowledge to solving real-world problems and creating well-designed, structured, and impactful software.
